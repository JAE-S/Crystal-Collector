### CRYSTAL COLLECTOR Instructions

* When the game begins you will be given a magic number between 19 - 120.

* You will also recieve four crystals, each with its own hidden value.

* Try to match the magic number by clicking the crystals. This will reveal the crystal's value and add it to your total. 

* If your total is the same as the magic number you will win that round.

* If your total is not the same as the magic number you will lose that round.

* After the game is over you will be given the option to play again. Each additional round will assign new values to the magic number and crystals.
